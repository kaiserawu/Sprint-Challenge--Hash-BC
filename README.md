# Sprint Challenge: Hash Tables and Blockchain

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in a concrete project. This Sprint, we learned how hash tables combine two data structures to get the best of both worlds and were introduced into the fascinating world of blockchains. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by solving algorithms in Python using hash tables and add another key feature to your blockchain.

## Instructions

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support from your PM and Instructor in your cohort help channel on Slack. Your work reflects your proficiency in Python and your command of the concepts and techniques in related to hash tables and blockchains.

You have three hours to complete this challenge. Plan your time accordingly.

## Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. This helps both you (in case you ever need to return to old code for any number of reasons and your project manager.

## Description

This sprint challenge is divided up into three parts:  Hash tables coding, blockchain coding, and a short interview covering parts of hash tables and blockchain.

## Interview Questions

Explain in detail the workings of a dynamic array:
* What is the runtime complexity to access an array, add or remove from the front, and add or remove from the back?
    Access and add/remove from back are O(1), as accessing simply requires the array locating the index, which is a quick mathematical process, and adding and removing from the back only requires the modification of one value, which is a constant speed event. Adding or removing from the front requires O(n) time, as the rest of the values in the array need to shift forward or back one place to keep things sorted correctly, as such, all items in the array need to be touched once to add or remove from the front, thus O(n).
* What is the worse case scenario if you try to extend the storage size of a dynamic array?
    Extending the storage size of a dynamic array would be O(n), since it requires making a new, larger array, and then copying over every value from the original array, before setting a pointer to the new array. Since every value in the old array needs to be copied over, it's an O(n) operation.

Explain how a blockchain is structured. What are the blocks, what is the chain? How is the data organized?
    A blockchain is structured similarly to a linked list, in that the previous blocks denote the location of the next block. Each block is an object that holds a set of transactions and the basic security data used to implement a blockchain. The chain the overall structure holding all the blocks and the methods used to create and modify said blocks. Each time a new block is found, it's added to the end of the list, and new transactions are added to the next block until it gets mined.
 
Explain how proof of work functions. How does it operate. How does this protect the chain from attack. What kind of attack is possible?
    Each block uses a hashing function on the previous block along with a proof of work value that, when hashed together, creates a value that meets some predetermined parameter. The validity of the proof of work gets checked, and only once valid does the block get added. The chain is protected by this because if someone tries to modify previous blocks, they'd change the hash of that block, thus invalidating the proof of work for that block as well, meaning the only way to get away with doing something like that would be to reproof all the blocks after it in the chain, faster than the work that's being done currently to mine new ones, which would pretty much only be possible if you had over 50% of the computing power being used in the system at that moment.

## Project Set Up

#### [Hash Tables]

For the hash tables portion of the sprint challenge, you'll be working through two algorithm problems that are amenable to being solved efficiently using a hash table. You know the drill at this point. Navigate into each exercise's directory, read the instructions for the exercise laid out in the README, implement your solution in the .py skeleton file, then make sure your code passes the tests by running the test script with make tests.

A hash table implementation has been included for you already. Your task is to get the tests passing (using a hash table to do it). You can remind yourself of what hash table functions are available by looking at the hashtable.py file that is included in each exercise directory (note that the hash table implementations for both exercises differ slightly).

*You may not use any advanced, built-in Python functions to solve these problems.*

#### [Blockchain]

For the blockchain portion of the challenge, you will be writing code for a new miner that will solve a different Proof of Work algorithm than the one we have been working with.

Your goal is to mine at least one coin.  Keep in mind that with many people competing over the same coins, this may take a long time.  By our math, we expect that an average solution should be the first to find a solution at least once in an hour or two of mining.
